### Overview:
As part of the WDI course, the week 12 project was to build a full-stack application using any technology, framework and tools of your choice.

The brief of the project was to:
- Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end
- Have an API of your design
- Have an interactive front-end, preferably using a modern front-end framework
- Use a database, whether that's one we've covered in class or one you want to learn
- Implement thoughtful user stories that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap
- Have a visually impressive design to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers
- Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible
